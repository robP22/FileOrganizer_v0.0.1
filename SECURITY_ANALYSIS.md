# Security Risk Analysis - File Organizer v0.0.1

**Analysis Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Codebase Version:** MVP Development Phase  
**Scope:** Current implementation + planned features per README.md

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY RISKS

### 1. **Command Injection Vulnerability** (CVSS: 9.1 - Critical)
**File:** `src/services/file_service.py:48`
```python
subprocess.run(command + [target_path], check=True)
```

**Risk:** User-controlled `directory_path` passed directly to system commands
**Attack Vector:** 
- Malicious path like `"; rm -rf /; #"` could execute arbitrary commands
- Path traversal attacks (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- Shell metacharacter injection

**Current Mitigation:** ‚úÖ Using list format prevents basic shell injection
**Missing Mitigation:** ‚ùå No path sanitization or validation before subprocess call

**Remediation Required:**
- Validate and sanitize all paths before system calls
- Use absolute path resolution
- Implement path allowlisting

---

### 2. **Unrestricted File System Access** (CVSS: 8.5 - High)
**Current State:** Application can access any directory user has permissions for
**Future Risk:** When file operations (move/copy/organize) are implemented

**Attack Scenarios:**
- User could select system directories (`/etc`, `/System`, `C:\Windows`)
- Organize malware into system folders
- Overwrite critical system files
- Access sensitive user data in other directories

**Remediation Required:**
- Implement directory restrictions (blacklist system folders)
- Require explicit user confirmation for sensitive locations
- Add file type restrictions for organization

---

### 3. **Event System Security Gap** (CVSS: 7.3 - High)
**File:** `src/core/events.py`
**Risk:** Global event bus with no access control

**Attack Vectors:**
- Any component can publish any event type
- No authentication/authorization on event subscriptions
- Potential for event flooding/DoS
- Cross-component data leakage through events

**Current State:** 
- Events contain directory paths in plaintext
- No validation of event publishers
- No rate limiting

**Future Risk:** When plugins/extensions are added, malicious code could:
- Subscribe to sensitive events
- Publish fake events to trigger unintended actions
- Intercept file operation events

---

## üü† HIGH SECURITY RISKS

### 4. **File Path Traversal** (CVSS: 6.8 - Medium-High)
**Files:** All path handling components
**Risk:** `../` path traversal not validated

**Attack Examples:**
```
Source: /Users/victim/Documents
Destination: ../../../etc/
Result: Files organized into system directories
```

**Remediation:** Path canonicalization and boundary checking

---

### 5. **Metadata Extraction Security** (CVSS: 6.5 - Medium-High)
**Future Implementation:** Per README - ExifRead, Pillow, pymediainfo, python-docx

**Risks:**
- **Malicious EXIF data** could exploit image processing libraries
- **ZIP bombs** in document metadata extraction
- **XXE attacks** in XML-based document formats
- **Buffer overflows** in media file parsing

**Planned Libraries Security Status:**
- ExifRead: Potential for malicious EXIF payload processing
- Pillow: History of image processing vulnerabilities
- pymediainfo: Native library dependencies with potential vulnerabilities

---

### 6. **JSON Configuration Injection** (CVSS: 6.2 - Medium-High)
**Future Feature:** "JSON-based rules" per README

**Risks:**
- User-provided JSON rules could contain malicious payloads
- Deserialization vulnerabilities
- Code injection through eval() in rule processing
- Path injection in rule template processing

---

## üü° MEDIUM SECURITY RISKS

### 7. **Denial of Service (DoS)** (CVSS: 5.5 - Medium)
**Multiple Vectors:**

**Event Bus DoS:**
- Unlimited event publishing could overwhelm system
- No rate limiting on file manager requests

**File Processing DoS:**
- Large file processing without limits
- Infinite recursion in directory traversal
- Memory exhaustion from large file lists

**GUI DoS:**
- Rapid button clicking could spawn unlimited subprocesses

---

### 8. **Information Disclosure** (CVSS: 5.3 - Medium)
**Current Risks:**
- File paths exposed in event system logs
- Error messages could reveal system information
- GUI labels show full file paths (potential shoulder surfing)

**Future Risks:**
- Metadata extraction could expose sensitive embedded data
- Progress tracking could leak file names/counts
- Log files containing sensitive path information

---

### 9. **Privilege Escalation Preparation** (CVSS: 5.0 - Medium)
**Future Risk:** When file operations are implemented
- Application could be tricked into modifying files it shouldn't
- TOCTOU (Time of Check Time of Use) race conditions
- Symlink attacks redirecting file operations

---

## üîµ LOW/INFORMATIONAL RISKS

### 10. **Insufficient Error Handling Security**
- Exceptions could leak system information
- No security logging of failed operations
- Silent failures could mask attacks

### 11. **Missing Input Validation**
- No maximum path length checks
- No file extension validation
- No directory depth limits

### 12. **Cross-Platform Security Inconsistencies**
- Different OS-specific security models not addressed
- Platform-specific path handling vulnerabilities

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Before Testing)
1. **Path Sanitization:** Implement strict path validation in FileService
2. **Event Authentication:** Add publisher validation to event system
3. **Subprocess Hardening:** Additional validation before system calls

### Pre-Production Requirements
1. **Security Code Review:** Professional security audit
2. **Penetration Testing:** Automated and manual security testing
3. **Dependency Scanning:** Monitor all third-party libraries for CVEs
4. **Sandboxing:** Consider running file operations in restricted environment

### Architecture Security Enhancements
1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize file system access scope
2. **Input Validation Framework:** Centralized validation for all user inputs
3. **Security Logging:** Comprehensive audit trail of all operations
4. **Rate Limiting:** Prevent DoS through operation throttling

### Secure Development Practices
1. **SAST/DAST Integration:** Automated security testing in CI/CD
2. **Security Training:** Team education on secure coding practices
3. **Threat Modeling:** Regular security architecture reviews
4. **Incident Response Plan:** Procedures for security vulnerability handling
