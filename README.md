# FileOrganizer_v0.0.1
# MVP Document: File Organizer Application

## Overview

This application provides a desktop GUI for organizing files from a source directory into structured destination folders based on file metadata (creation date). The application follows an event-driven, highly decoupled architecture to maximize modularity and extensibility. Users can select directories, configure organization settings, and execute file operations with real-time progress tracking and comprehensive error handling.

---

## User Flow (MVP)

1. **Application Launch** → Main window opens
2. **Source Selection** → User selects source directory containing files to organize
3. **Destination Selection** → User selects target directory for organized files
4. **Status Validation** → Status bar shows "Ready" (green) when both directories are selected and validated
5. **Organization Configuration** → *Future feature: Templates and naming conventions*
6. **Begin Process** → User clicks "Begin" button
7. **Confirmation Modal** → User reviews configuration and confirms or cancels
8. **Progress Tracking** → Real-time progress bar with file count (processed/total)
9. **Completion/Error Handling** → Results dialog shows success or error details

## Architecture Overview

The application uses a **hybrid event-driven architecture** combining:
- **Event-Driven Communication** for maximum component decoupling
- **Command Pattern** for file operations with undo/retry capabilities
- **Observer Pattern** for real-time progress and status updates
- **Strategy Pattern** for future organization template extensibility

### Core Principles:
- **Maximum Decoupling**: Each component operates independently
- **Event-Based Communication**: Components communicate via publish/subscribe events
- **Testability**: Real file system testing with backed-up data
- **Extensibility**: Template system for future organization strategies

## Features (MVP)

### Core Functionality
1. **Directory Selection**
   - Source directory picker with validation
   - Destination directory picker with validation
   - Real-time status updates

2. **File Organization**
   - Date-based folder creation (Year, Year/Month, Year/Month/Day)
   - Metadata-driven file placement
   - Batch file operations with progress tracking

3. **Validation & Safety**
   - Disk space verification before operations
   - File accessibility and permission checks
   - Basic file integrity validation

4. **Progress & Status Management**
   - Real-time progress tracking (processed/total files)
   - Status bar with visual indicators (Ready/Processing/Error)
   - Comprehensive error reporting and recovery

5. **Error Handling**
   - **Critical Errors** (disk space, destination conflicts): Stop entire process
   - **Non-Critical Errors** (corrupted files): Save for retry, continue with remaining files
   - User choice for retry/skip failed operations

### User Interface
- **Main Window**: Directory selection, status display, action buttons
- **Confirmation Modal**: Configuration review before execution
- **Progress Dialog**: Real-time operation feedback
- **Results Dialog**: Success/error summary with details

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Custom organization templates (foundation laid for future implementation)
- File deletion/removal capabilities
- Advanced file corruption detection beyond basic checks
- Undo/redo functionality (architecture supports future addition)
- Batch operation scheduling

### Technology Stack
- **GUI Framework**: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- **File Operations**: `pathlib`, `shutil`, `os`
- **Configuration**: JSON-based settings persistence
- **Testing**: Real file system testing with pytest
- **Architecture Patterns**: Event-driven, Command, Observer, Strategy

## Data Requirements

### Application State
- Source directory path and validation status
- Destination directory path and validation status
- Organization configuration (current: date-based, future: templates)
- Operation progress and status
- Error tracking and retry queue

### File Metadata
- Absolute file path
- File name and extension
- File size and creation date
- Accessibility and permission status
- Corruption check results

### Configuration Persistence
- User preferences (JSON format)
- Organization templates (future)
- Application settings and window state

## Error Handling Strategy

### Critical Errors (Stop Process)
- Insufficient disk space in destination
- Destination path conflicts
- Permission denied on destination directory

### Non-Critical Errors (Continue with Retry Option)
- Individual file corruption
- Individual file permission issues
- Network drive accessibility (future)

### Error Recovery
- Failed file paths stored for retry attempts
- User choice: retry failed operations or skip
- Detailed error reporting in results dialog

- User-defined folder naming conventions
- Template sharing and import/export
- Custom metadata-based organization rules

### Additional Features (Post-MVP)

- Duplicate file detection and handling
- Automated organization scheduling
- Plugin system for custom organizers
