# FileOrganizer_v0.0.1
# MVP Document: File Organizer Application

## Overview

This application provides a **privacy-first, cross-platform desktop GUI** for organizing files from a source directory into structured destination folders based on file metadata and user-defined rules. Built with **zero data collection** and **local-only processing**, FileOrganizer ensures your files and metadata never leave your computer. The application follows an event-driven, highly decoupled architecture to maximize modularity, extensibility, and security across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### 🔒 Privacy-First Features
- **Local-Only Processing**: All operations happen entirely on your device
- **Zero Telemetry**: No data collection, analytics, or usage tracking
- **Granular Privacy Controls**: Choose exactly what metadata to extract
- **No Network Dependencies**: Never connects to internet or cloud services
- **Open Source**: Fully auditable code for transparency

## User Flow (MVP)

1. **Application Launch** → Main window opens
2. **Source Selection** → User selects source directory containing files to organize
3. **Destination Selection** → User selects target directory for organized files
4. **Status Validation** → Status bar shows "Ready" (green) when both directories are selected and validated
5. **Organization Configuration** → Select rule-based or date-based organization strategy
6. **Begin Process** → User clicks "Begin" button
7. **Confirmation Modal** → User reviews configuration and confirms or cancels
8. **Progress Tracking** → Real-time progress bar with file count (processed/total)
9. **Completion/Error Handling** → Results dialog shows success or error details

## Architecture Overview

The application uses a **hybrid event-driven architecture** combining:
- **Event-Driven Communication** for maximum component decoupling
- **Command Pattern** for file operations with undo/retry capabilities
- **Observer Pattern** for real-time progress and status updates
- **Strategy Pattern** for future organization template extensibility

### Core Principles:
- **Maximum Decoupling**: Each component operates independently
- **Event-Based Communication**: Components communicate via publish/subscribe events
- **Testability**: Real file system testing with backed-up data
- **Extensibility**: Template system for future organization strategies
